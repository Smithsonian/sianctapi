# edan-module
SI EDAN Modules for Drupal. This package contains several modules designed to make it easy to add EDAN's search and record capabilities to your website. The edan.module provides a basic, Drupal-managed, connection system for custom code. The EDANInterface.php library can also be used in any PHP script to facilitate communication with EDAN.

In order to use EDAN services you will need an application ID (AppID) which can be requested from the LASSB team within OCIO.
